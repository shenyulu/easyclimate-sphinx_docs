.. Easy climate
.. =======================================

.. .. image:: _static/easyclimate-logo.svg

.. Easy climate is a Python library for processing spatial data (bathymetry, geophysics surveys, etc) 
.. and interpolating it on regular grids (i.e., gridding).

.. Our core interpolation methods are inspired by machine-learning. 
.. As such, Verde implements an interface that is similar to the popular scikit-learn library. 
.. We also provide other analysis methods that are often used in combination with gridding, 
.. like trend removal, blocked/windowed operations, cross-validation, and more!
